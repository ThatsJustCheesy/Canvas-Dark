# Quercus/Canvas Dark

## LMS ≠ Light eMitting Site

Are you:

- A user of UofT Quercus or another Canvas LMS instance?
- Allergic to the color `#fff`?

If yes, this userstyle can help.

## Install

1. Install Stylus for [Chromium (Chrome etc.)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/styl-us/), or Cascadea for [Safari](https://cascadea.app/).
2. Install the style from [this URL](https://github.com/ThatsJustCheesy/Canvas-Dark/raw/master/canvas_dark.user.css). For Stylus, just click the link and an installation page should appear. For Cascadea, you should be prompted to allow the page to open the dekstop app; if you aren't, copy the URL, click File > Import From > URL…, and paste it there.

## Known issues

Some backgrounds will be white and some text will be unreadable. In particular, you should disable this style to take a quiz.
